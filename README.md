# Blackjack-Game-and-Simulator

Blackjack (The game where you try and get to 21 without going bust) in python using OOP. Variable rules available, run setup.py to get started.

It is only text-based for now, will think about adding a GUI to the game side

Simulator currently not implemented, working on it
